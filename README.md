[OCI CLI](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/tools/oci-cli/3.20.3/oci_cli_docs/) plugin for [asdf version manager](https://asdf-vm.com) allowing you to pin `oci` versions for each GCP project.

# Dependencies

Are tracked in [lib/dependencies.txt](lib/dependencies.txt) and checked on installation of plugin and `asdf install oci *`. The core dependencies are: `bash`, `curl`, `python`, `sort`, `tar`.

# Install

Plugin:

```shell
asdf plugin add oci https://github.com/jbwinters/asdf-oci
```

OCI:

```shell
asdf install oci latest
```

Set global version:

```shell
asdf global oci latest
```

These commands also apply to `asdf local oci <version>`.

# Why?

The asdf config file, `.tool-versions`, allows pinning each tool in your project to a specific version. This ensures that ALL developers are using the same version of each tool. Same `python`, same `oci`, same `terraform` etc.

When you update a version in `.tool-versions`, `asdf` will prompt all users who do not have the correct versions to upgrade. This enables whole teams to update their tools in unison.

## Why are there Node deps here?

I decided the value of [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/#/) & sharing Git Hooks with [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) were greater than the cost of including these deps. Not only this, but dogfooding `asdf` for dev deps makes this less of an issue.
